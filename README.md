# Homework-Angular-JS-Meteo

** Final homework for JS course ... Yaaay !!!
Create a NodeJS application that will notify a list of email receivers about next day meteo.
- The application needs to be started as server (you can use **express** for that)
- At a regular interval of time, a request to a public meteo api will be done that will get meteo data for a city (Chișinău for example)
- If a receiver email didn't received an email with next day meteo data, an email with needed information will be sent
- Data, as the email list, needs to be included in a **config.json** file that will save data between sessions

To sumbit your home work, clone this repo, add your files in to a new folder (the name of your folder will be you.firstName + you.lastName), and make a pull request for your modifications with me as reviewer :)
